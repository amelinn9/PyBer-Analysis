According to the PyBer Summary DataFrame, the rural city type had the lowest total rides (125) and the lowest total drivers (78). The urban city type had the highest total rides (1,625) and the highest total drivers (2,405). The suburban city type had a total ride count and total driver count of “625” and “490”, respectively. The urban city type had the highest total fares ($39,854.38), followed by the suburban city type ($19,356.33), and the rural city type ($4,327.93). There is also an inverse relationship between the “Total Riders” and “Total Drivers” with the “Average Fare per Ride and the “Average Fare per Driver”. The average fare decreases as the rides and drivers increase. The urban city type had the lowest average fare per ride ($24.53) and average fare per driver ($16.57). The rural city type has the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and average fare per driver ($55.49). The suburban city type had an average fare per ride and average fare per driver of “$30.97” and “$39.50”, respectively. The average fare per ride can be explained based on the distance or duration of the trips. The rural cities likely have longer trips, resulting in higher average fares, compared to the suburban and urban cities.
